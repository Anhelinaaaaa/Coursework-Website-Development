        <H2>Bombing of Chernihiv</H2>
        <hr>
        <p> On 3 March 2022, just after 12:00 (UTC+2), six Russian unguided aerial bombs were filmed falling in a residential area in Chernihiv.[21] Analysis by Amnesty International found that (at least) eight bombs fell.[22] Two schools (No.18 and No.21) and 8 private houses in the intersection between the Viacheslava Chornovila and Kruhova streets ( WikiMiniAtlas51.5001°N 31.2791°E) were destroyed, 7 more houses were also heavily damaged in the vicinity of the Biloruskyi Lane.[23] Local emergency services recorded 38 men and 9 women killed (47 in total) by the bombing and 18 people injured.[21] As Amnesty International was unable to identify a legitimate military target nearby, it said the attack could be a war crime.[22] Human Rights Watch (HRW) found no evidence of a "significant [military] target in or near the intersection when it was hit ... pointing to a potentially deliberate or reckless indiscriminate attack". HRW called for an International Criminal Court investigation and a United Nations commission of inquiry to decide if a war crime had occurred and to hold to account the people responsible. The HRW investigation included telephone interviews with three witnesses and two other Chernihiv residents, and analysis of 22 videos and 12 photographs. The witnesses interviewed by HRW stated that they were unaware of military targets or operations in the neighbourhood.[24] Matilda Bogner, Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, stated that the bombing "violated the principles of distinction, of proportionality, the rule on feasible precautions and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks".[4] A bomb crater consistent with a 500 kg bomb was found. FAB-500 bombs were known to be used during the invasion.[22]</p>
        <p>On 16 March 2022, a Russian attack killed 14 civilians who were waiting in a line for bread in the city, The event was reported by Governor of Chernihiv Oblast Vyacheslav Chaus and the United States Embassy in Kyiv.[25] The incident happened at around 10:00 UTC+3. Victims of the incident were killed following a blast shot from heavy artillery.[26] These civilians were unarmed and some of them survived the shelling; they were taken to medical facilities by the Chernihiv police.[27] An American citizen was among the dead.[28] Around four hours after the incident, the Chernihiv Regional Prosecutor's Office filed a legal case regarding the attack. The Chernihiv Oblast branch of the Security Service of Ukraine also started an investigation.[26]</p>

        <p>On 19 August 2023 at about 11:30 Saturday morning seven civilians were killed, dozens hospitalized, and over a 150 injured after Russian Armed Forces launched a 9М727 Iskander cruise missile and hit the Taras Shevchenko Music and Drama Theater at Krasna Square, the city center.[29] The detonator of the warhead of the missile was configured for air detonation,[30] so all the dead and the vast majority of the injured were from outside the drama theater.[31] According to the acting mayor of the city, the military exhibition held in the building was the likely target.[32] Early reporting indicated five people killed and 42 injured, including 11 children presumably among the injured. The estimates went up to 90 injured, including 25 hospitalized, and six dead after a six-year-old child died in the hospital, and then seven dead after another women's body was found.[33][34]</p>

<h2>Donetsk Oblast</h2>
<hr>
<p>There were at least 7,395 civilian casualties (of which 3,511 killed) in the government-controlled territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and 2,035 civilian casualties (of which 467 killed) in the territory controlled by the Russian forces and affiliated groups between February and November 2022.[67] The months-long siege of Mariupol caused a large number of civilian casualties and a few other attacks with many civilian casualties occurred in the oblast. Donetsk itself experienced several attacks with civilian casualties, including the shelling of a market and the mayor's office. Pro-Russian officials blamed Ukraine for the attacks while Ukraine blamed Russia or did not comment on the attacks.[68][69]</p>
<p>On 8 August 2022 the UK Ministry of Defence issued a statement accusing Russia of using anti-personnel PFM-1 scatterable anti-personnel mines along the defensive lines in Donbas, adding that such mines are undiscriminate and pose a threat to civilians.[70]</p>

<h3><b>Vuhledar cluster bomb attack</b></h3>
<p>On 24 February 2022, 10:30 (UTC), Vuhledar was attacked with an 9M79 Tochka missile, which landed next to a hospital and killed four civilians and injured ten.[19]Amnesty International described it as "irrefutable evidence of violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law" by Russian forces.[71] Human Rights Watch (HRW) found that the Vuhledar hospital attack used a 9N123 cluster munition. The 9N123 contains fifty 9N24 individual submunitions, which each split into 316 bomblets. HRW based its analysis on contacts with the hospital and municipal administrations and multiple photographic evidence. HRW called for Russian forces to stop making "unlawful attacks with weapons that indiscriminately kill and maim".[6] The press secretary of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, denied Russian involvement, saying that this type of ammunition is used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.[72]</p>

<h3><b>Lyman cluster bomb attack</b></h3>
<p>On 8 July 2023, Russian cluster bombs launched by a BM-30 Smerch struck a residential area of Lyman, in Donetsk Oblast. Nine civilians were killed and nineteen wounded. Witnesses said residents "had gathered to trade dairy products and fresh produce from their gardens, as they did most mornings". The use of cluster bombs in areas with civilians "makes an attack indiscriminate, in violation of international humanitarian law".[73]</p>

<h3><b>Siege of Mariupol</b></h3>
<p>Between 1–2 March 2022, Russian artillery reportedly shelled a densely populated neighbourhood in the city for nearly 15 hours, causing significant destruction. Deputy mayor Sergei Orlov reported that "at least hundreds of people [were] dead."[74] On 16 March the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Russian forces continued to commit war crimes in Mariupol including "targeting civilian infrastructure".[75] On 18 March, Lieutenant General James Hockenhull, Chief of Defence Intelligence for the United Kingdom (UK), described "continued targeting of civilians in Mariupol".[76] As of 20 March local authorities have estimated that at least 2,300 people were killed during the siege.[77]</p>

<p>On 20 March 2022, Ukrainian authorities announced that Russian troops had bombed an art school in the city where hundreds (about 400) were sheltering.[78] The Mariupol City Council made the announcement through the instant messaging service Telegram, highlighting that many of those sheltering in the school were women, children and elderly.[79] However, Petro Andryushchenko, an advisor to the Mayor of Mariupol, raised the concern that there was no exact number on how many people were using the school as a refuge.[80]</p>
<p>By 18 April, Ukrainian officials estimated that at least 95% of Mariupol had been destroyed in the fighting, largely as a result of the Russian bombing campaigns.[81] City officials reported that up to 21,000 civilians had been killed.[82][83] On 16 June, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that evidence strongly suggests the Russian armed forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in Mariupol, including the shelling and rocket attacks that destroyed much of the city.[84][85] In a separate statement, Human Rights Watch said Russia's military tactics were indiscriminate and caused a disproportionate effect on the civilians in the city. It also warned that going forward, access to the city and preservation of evidence were likely to be issues, given Russia's occupation of the city, and it called for international accountability.[86]</p>
<p>Independent media and the Ukrainian side accused the Russian military of bombing civilian shelters with cluster munitions during shelling of the city and attacks on Azovstal.[87] According to the mayor of Mariupol, at the end of April, during the two-month siege of the city by Russian troops, more than 20 thousand people died - twice as many than the 2 year occupation of the city during World War II.[88] Oksana Pokalchuk, director of Amnesty International Ukraine, said they were able to prove the use of cluster munitions by Russia after interviewing a victim who provided them with a fragment of ammunition that was removed from his thigh.[89]</p>

<h3><b>Targeting of humanitarian corridors</b></h3>
<p>During shelling of Mariupol by Russian forces, a number of attempts to establish a humanitarian evacuation corridor to evacuate civilians from the city were made, but failed when the corridor was targeted by Russian forces.[90] On 5 March, a five-hour ceasefire was declared, but evacuations were quickly halted after shelling continued during the declared time.[91] The next day, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced that a second attempt to establish an evacuation corridor had failed.[92][93]</p>

<h3><b>Mariupol hospital airstrike</b></h3>

</figure>
<p>On 9 March 2022, the Children's and Maternity Hospital No. 3, a hospital complex functioning both as a children's hospital and maternity ward,[94] was bombed several times by Russian forces during a ceasefire, killing at least four people and injuring at least seventeen, also leading to at least one stillbirth[95] Ukrainian authorities described the damage to the hospital as "colossal". Video footage following the attacks showed "much of the front of the building ... ripped away" and "mangled cars burning outside".[96] Hospital wards were "reduced to a wreckage, walls [had] collapsed, rubble cover[ed] medical equipment, windows [were] blown out and shattered glass [was] everywhere".[97] On 10 March, local authorities stated that one girl and two other people had been killed in the bombing, one of whom was a woman at a late stage of pregnancy; neither she nor her unborn child survived.[98] Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that people had "hidden" from the attack in time, minimising the number of casualties.[99]</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor of Mariupol, Sergei Orlov, stated, "We don't understand how it is possible in modern life to bomb [a] children's hospital."[95] Mariupol City Council described the bombing by Russian aircraft as deliberate.[95] Zelenskyy claimed that the attack constituted "proof that the genocide of Ukrainians [was] taking place".[99] Sergei Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, described the attack as both a war crime and genocide.[100] British prime minister Boris Johnson described the attack as "depraved".[96] Jen Psaki, press secretary of United States president Joe Biden, stated that "It is horrifying to see the ... barbaric use of military force to go after innocent civilians in a sovereign country."[96] Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, described the bombing as a "heinous war crime".[98] Cardinal Secretary of State of the Vatican City Pietro Parolin expressed dismay at the bombing, calling it an "unacceptable attack on civilians".[101] António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, wrote that the attack was "horrific" and that "this senseless violence must stop."[10</p>
<p>On 10 March, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence publicly claimed that the bombing was justified. According to Ukrainska Pravda, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed that the bombing of the hospital was a deliberate action. He stated, "A few days ago, at a UN Security Council meeting, the Russian delegation presented factual information that this maternity hospital had long been taken over by the Azov Battalion and other radicals and that all the women in labour, all the nurses and in general all the staff had been told to leave it. It was a base of the ultra-radical Azov Battalion."[103] On 10 March 2022, Twitter removed a tweet from the Russian embassy in the UK which claimed that the Mariupol hospital attack was "fake" and that Marianna Vyshegirskaya, one of the victims, was an "actress" by citing her blogging career, as a violation of Twitter rules. British politicians welcomed the move and accused the Russian embassy of disinformation.[104] Meduza stated that the Russian representative to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, had on 7 March referred to Maternity Hospital No 1 (47.13892°N 37.60337°E) as a hospital that he claimed was used by Ukrainian armed forces as a firing point, not Maternity Hospital No 3. Meduza described Lavrov as having confused Hospital No 1, referred to by Nebenzya, with the hospital that was bombed, Hospital No 3.[94] On 22 March 2022, Russian journalist Alexander Nevzorov was charged under Russia's "fake news" law after he published information about the Russian shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol.[105] Under a new law passed on 4 March, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.[106]</p>

<h3><b>Mariupol theatre airstrike</b></h3>
<p>On 16 March, Ukraine accused Russian forces of shelling civilian areas in Mariupol. Artillery hit numerous locations, including a swimming pool building and a vehicle convoy; shelling then struck the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre that was being used as an air raid shelter with a large number of civilians inside, the building was reduced to rubble.[107] The bomb shelter in the basement of the theatre survived the bombing, but many people were still trapped underneath the burning rubble. A member of the Ukrainian parliament from Mariupol, Dmytro Gurin, said that the rescue efforts were hampered due to continued attacks on the area by Russian forces.[108]</p>

</figure>
<p>By 17 March, the number of casualties was unclear; some emerged alive.[109] By 18 March, around 130 survivors had been rescued.[110] Mariupol City Council stated that according to initial information, no one had been killed, although one person was gravely wounded.[111] On 25 March, Mariupol City Council estimated that about 300 people had been killed as a result of the airstrike.[112] On 4 May, Associated Press published an investigation with evidence pointing to 600 dead in the airstrike. Many survivors estimated around 200 people–including rescuers–escaping through the main exit or one side entrance; the other side and the back were crushed.[113] Estimates of civilian deaths vary, ranging from at least a dozen (Amnesty International)[114] to 600 (Associated Press).[113] At least eleven are confirmed by a Russian source.[115]</p>
<p>Ukraine accused the Russian Armed Forces of deliberately bombing the theatre while it was sheltering civilians.[116] Russia first claimed that the reason the theatre was bombed was because it was "being used as a base by the Ukrainian military", and then denied the allegations and instead accused the Azov Battalion of blowing up the building, Both Russian claims have been refuted by independent investigation.[117] The theatre is among the many Ukrainian heritage and cultural sites destroyed during the invasion. The attack was classified as a war crime by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe[118] and Amnesty International.[114]</p>

<h3><b>Kramatorsk railway station attack</b></h3>
<p>On 8 April 2022, at 10:24 and 10:25, media affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic published videos showing a pair of missiles being launched from Shakhtarsk, a city under separatist control.[119] At approximately 10:30, two missiles hit near the railway station building in Kramatorsk,[120] and the first reports were published in Ukrainian media at around 10:45.[119] According to the Ukrainian government, between 1000 and 4000 civilians, mainly women and children, were present at the station awaiting evacuation from the region, which was being subjected to heavy Russian shelling.[121] the attack left at least 60 dead and 110+ wounded.[19]: para. 32  The missiles were initially misidentified as Iskander ballistic missiles.[122] Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of Donetsk oblast, later specified that they had rather been Tochka-U missiles armed with cluster munitions.[120] The remnants of one of the missiles had the Russian words ЗА ДЕТЕЙ (za detey), meaning "[in revenge] for the children", painted in white on its outside.[123] It also bore serial number Ш91579, which investigators said could potentially help trace it back to its original arsenal.[124]</p>

</figure>
<p>Initially, Russian state media and pro-Russian telegram channels claimed successful Russian airstrikes on a military transport target in Kramatorsk.[125] However, after it became clear that the missiles had killed civilians, earlier reports were redacted, the Russian government also denied responsibility for the attack, and the Russian Ministry of Defence characterized it as a "Ukrainian hoax".[126] The Russian Ministry of Defence later claimed that the missiles were launched by Ukrainian forces from the city of Dobropillia, southwest of Kramatorsk.[127] Russian media also said that the serial number of the missile was in the same range as one used by Ukrainian forces, however, these claims were rapidly debunked.[128] A fake video clip with a mock BBC logo, attributing blame to the Ukrainian forces, circulated through pro-Russian telegram channels and Russian state television since 10 April. However, the BBC said that it has not produced any such video.[129] The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that their forces no longer use Tochka-U missiles. However, Amnesty International had published videos about use of Tochka-U missiles in other cities before Kramatorsk.[130] investigators from the open-source Belarusian Hajun project had also published videos of several Russian trucks with Tochka missiles heading from Belarus to Ukraine with 'V' markings on 5 and 30 March.[131] The Institute for the Study of War assessed that the Russian 8th Guards Combined Arms Army, which is active in the Donbas area, is equipped with Tochka-U missiles.[132]</p>
<p>Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,[133] Dunja Mijatović, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights,[134] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,[135] European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen,[136] French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian,[137] British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace,[138] United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres[138] and Oleksandr Kamyshin, chairman of Ukrainian Railways[139] described the event as "war crimes" and "a crime against humanity" by Russian forces. The Security Service of Ukraine opened criminal proceedings under Article 438 of the Criminal Code.[140] Royal United Services Institute analyst Justin Bronk said that Russia aimed to damage Ukrainian transport infrastructure to make it difficult for Ukrainian forces to move around Donbas. He also suggested that Russia opted for the Tochka-U missile type due to its use by the Ukrainian army, in order to "muddy the waters".[138] The Pentagon highlighted Russian responsibility for the attack, as well as the strategic importance of the railway junction.[141]</p>

<h3><b>Kramatorsk restaurant strike</b></h3>
<p>On 27 June 2023, Russian forces attacked a pizza restaurant in Kramatorsk with an Iskander missile, killing 13 people including four children and Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina. About sixty people were wounded.[142]</p>

<p>Kramatorsk was about 18 miles (30 km) from the eastern frontline.[143] The restaurant was popular with local civilians, war correspondents, humanitarian volunteers, as well as Ukrainian soldiers on leave to 'rest and recuperate' and meet their loved ones.[144] Several journalists were having a meal when the missile struck, including three Colombians.[143] Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the strike targeted a "temporary command post" of the Ukrainian army. Ukraine's prosecutor general said the missile has high precision, "which means Russia was deliberately targeting civilians".[143] Ukraine's Security Service later arrested a local man who allegedly helped co-ordinate the strike with the Russian military.[143]</p>

<p>On 9 July 2022, a missile strike on two residential buildings in Chasiv Yar was carried out by the Russian Armed Forces[145] at 21:17 local time. At least 48 people were killed, Due to the impact, a five-story residential building partially collapsed. Two entrances were completely destroyed.[146] The strike was alleged, including by Donetsk Oblast governor Pavlo Kyrylenko,[147] to have been performed with "Uragan", a self-propelled 220 mm multiple rocket launcher designed in the Soviet Union.[148] The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that they destroyed a "temporary deployment point" of a Ukrainian territorial defence unit.[149] As of 10 July 67 rescue workers of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine were trying to help the victims[150] and more than 20 people were still feared to be trapped under the rubble.[151] Rescue and search operations continued until the morning of 14 July 2022. Rescuers dismantled about 525 tons of destroyed elements of the building. 323 employees of the State Emergency Service and 9 units of equipment were involved.[152] As of 13 July 48 dead were found under the rubble of the building,[153] and nine wounded were rescued as of 12 July.[148] A local resident told The New York Times that there were 10 elderly civilians in the buildings, but that members of the military had come to lodge there two days earlier. Two soldiers who probably took turns sleeping in the building after being on duty were among the dead.[154] Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukraine's president, said that the strike was "another terrorist attack" and that Russia should be designated a "state sponsor of terrorism" as a result.[155] Russian military spokesman Igor Konashenkov stated that Russia had killed "over 300 nationalists" in an attack on Chasiv Yar, but did not specify whether or not they were referring to the July airstrike or an earlier attack.[156]</p>

<h3><b>Donetsk City</b></h3>
<p>On 27 July 2022, thousands of miniature plastic antipersonnel PFM-1 mines were dispersed over civilian areas of the Russian held city of Donetsk by a BM-27 Uragan multiple rocket launcher. This resulted in a number of people being injured, most prominently Semen Pegov, a Russian war blogger calling himself "War Gonzo".[157] The Russian Foreign Ministry and local sources accused the Ukrainian army of being responsible for their deployment. The so-called "butterfly mines" are banned under the 1997 Ottawa Treaty (signed by Ukraine but not by Russia) due to the high danger they pose to civilians.[158][159][160]</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch investigated the attack and concluded that the Russian forces used Smerch cluster munition rockets, which disperse dozens of submunitions or bomblets in the air.[168] As there were no military targets within 400 meters of these strikes and due to the indiscriminate use of these weapons against densely populated areas, HRW described these strikes as possible war crimes.[168] On 13 May, CNN reported that newly collected evidence identified Colonel General Alexander Zhuravlyov commanding the 79th Rocket Artillery Brigade, ordered the use 17 cluster bombs, the 300mm Smerch Cluster Rocket, to be used against civilian targets in Kharkiv on 27–28 February.[179]</p>

<p>In October 2024, Forbes reported that Russians were using drones to deliberately target civilians in Kherson, and then ″proudly″ sharing the footage of the attacks on social media. Attacks being ″shared and celebrated″ included on commuters, people at bus stops, and on children playing in parks. This terror campaign has become known as the ″Human Safari″. One of the instances described as a ″typical case″ was a Ukrainian mother-of-two who was cycling home when a Russian drone spotted her and followed her until dropping a grenade, which injured her with shrapnel, leaving her unable to walk. Imagery of the attack was posted on a Russian Telegram channel with a winking face emoji and falsely describing her as a soldier.[203][204]</p>

A fire broke out, and, according to Dmytro Lunin, Governor of Poltava Oblast, the attack killed at least 20 people and injured at least 56.[208] 36 people were also initially reported missing.[209] According to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the attack was carried out by Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bombers that took off from the Shaykovka air base in the Kaluga Oblast. The missiles were launched over the territory of the Kursk Oblast.[208] Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said that the missile hit the far end of the shopping mall.[210] The area of the resulting fire was more than 10,000 square metres (110,000 sq ft) and up to 115 firefighters and 20 fire-fighting appliances were involved in extinguishing it.[208]</p>

<p>On the day of the attack, Russian television did not report it until the Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that it had happened.[211] Pro-Russian Telegram channels have spread multiple conflicting theories about the missile strike, including the claim that the missile was aimed at a car factory near the mall, that the mall was being used as a military equipment warehouse, or as a base of the Territorial Defense Forces, and that the missile strike is a Ukrainian provocation involving the use of "canned bodies".[212] On the day after the attack, Russian authorities and state-controlled media issued a number of contradictory statements about the attack, including claims that the attack was "fake" and that the Ukrainian army had bombed the mall themselves.[213] Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: "The detonation of the munitions for western weaponry in storage led to a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre next to the factory."[214] The claims that the shopping mall was "non-functional" have been debunked by several organizations.[215] According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, there were more than 1,000 people inside the mall when the strike occurred,[216] The non-profit online journalism collective Bellingcat used receipts from recent purchases at the mall to prove that the mall had been open prior to the attack.[217] the BBC also published interviews with people who were working or shopping in the mall at the time.[218] Per reports from independent military experts and researchers with Molfar, a global open sourced intelligence community, the factory and mall were too far apart from one another to cause any fires or explosions.[217]</p>
<p>The leaders of the G7 nations,[219] US Secretary of State Antony Blinken[220] British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,[221] Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy,[222] Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba[223] and Mayor Vitalii Maletskyi [uk] described the attack as "war crimes", "crimes against humanity" and "indiscriminate attacks", as well claiming that the attack was intentional and that there were "no close military targets"[224]</p>

<h3><b>Irpin refugee column shelling</b></h3>
<p>On 6 March 2022, from 9:30 a.m. until 2 p.m. local time, the Russian Armed Forces repeatedly shelled an intersection in Irpin that hundreds of civilians were using to escape to Kyiv, whilst a Ukrainian artillery position was located nearby. They killed at least eight Ukrainian civilians (including 2 children). Human Rights Watch alleged the Russian army carried out an "unlawful, indiscriminate and disproportionate attack". The incident was part of an assault on Irpin.</p>

   <figcaption><I>Civilians fleeing over the Irpin River bridge, March 2022</I></figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>On that day, there were hundreds of civilians at the intersection on the P30 road, near the St. George's Ukrainian Orthodox Church, just south of a bridge that the Ukrainian army had destroyed to hinder the Russian invasion. The civilians were fleeing the Russian army's advance from Irpin towards Kyiv. In the intersection near the bridge were a dozen Ukrainian soldiers, some helping the civilians carry their luggage and children.[225] The Ukrainian artillery was firing mortar rounds from a position about 180 metres (590 ft) away.[225] No agreements had been reached between the parties about a temporary ceasefire or humanitarian corridor.[225] Journalists of The New York Times and freelance journalists on the scene report that for several hours the Russian army bombarded the intersection that the civilians were using to flee.[226] The Russians fired explosive projectiles into the area, with projectiles hitting the intersection or the surrounding area every 10 minutes,[225] Among the victims were a group of four, including two children, who were killed by a mortar strike.[227][228]</p>
<p>According to Human Rights Watch, it is possible that the projectiles were "observed" by the Russians, who would then know where they were landing and could easily have adjusted the aim away from the intersection. Instead they engaged in prolonged shelling of the intersection being used by civilians, which indicates "potential recklessness or deliberateness" on their part. The repeated nature of the attacks suggests that Russian forces "violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians, and failed to take all feasible measures to avoid civilian casualties".[225] The human rights organisation also stated that the Ukrainian forces "have an obligation to take all feasible precautions to avoid or minimize civilian harm," such as refraining from engaging in combat in populated areas.[225]</p>

<p>Only a few hundred residents remained in Borodianka by the time the Russians withdrew, with roughly 90% of residents having fled,[245] and an unknown number dead in the rubble.[243] Borodianka's mayor estimated at least 200 dead.[249] Agence France-Presse arrived in Borodianka on 5 April. The AFP did not see any bodies, but reported widespread destruction, and that some homes "simply no longer existed". The human death toll remained unclear: one resident reported that he knew of at least five civilians killed, but that others were beneath the rubble and that no one had yet attempted to extricate them.[250][248] According to Europe 1, ten days after the Russian army had left, firefighters were still working to recover bodies from the rubble in order to bury them with dignity. Their work was complicated by the risk of other buildings collapsing. More bodies were discovered daily. Local morgues were overwhelmed, and corpses had to be transported 100 kilometres or more.[243]</p>

<h3><b>Bucha massacre</b></h3>
<p>Ukrainian forensic investigations on the Bucha massacre revealed that dozens of civilians had been killed by metal darts ("fléchettes") of a kind used by the Russian army. Bodies from the Bucha-Irpin region showed lesions from small nail-like objects contained in tank or field gun shells. According to witnesses, Russian artillery fired shells that spread fléchettes a few days before retreating from the area at the end of March. While fléchettes are not prohibited under international law, their use in residential areas may qualify as the war crime of indiscriminate attack.[251] The spokesperson for the Ukrainian Ground Forces stated that Ukraine's military does not use shells with fléchettes.[252]</p>
<p>According to Oleg Tkalenko, deputy chief prosecutor of the Kyiv Oblast, forensic experts found fragments of cluster munitions in bodies from mass graves in Bucha after the retreat of Russian troops, the exact number of civilians killed specifically due to the use of cluster munitions in the village was unknown, but at least 8 out of about 500 of those found were reportedly killed by their use, The Guardian later confirmed the use of RBK-500 cluster munitions with PTAB-submunitions and cluster missiles fired by the BM-30 Smerch in Bucha.[246] The mayor of the city, Anatoly Fedoruk, stated that "Bucha was turned into a Chechen safari, where land mines were used against civilians".

<p>2 July was declared a day of mourning in the region.[281] Ukrainian President Zelenskyy accused Russia of having committed "an act of conscious, deliberately targeted Russian terror – and not some kind of mistake".[282] He noted that as in the recent Kremenchuk shopping mall attack, the Russian army "used unnecessarily powerful weapons to strike a civilian object".[213][283]</p>

<p>On 27 February 2022, Amnesty International said that evidence showed Russian cluster munitions from a 220 mm BM-27 Uragan rocket hit a preschool in Okhtyrka used as a civilian bomb shelter, killing three people including a child. UAV film showed four hits on the roof of the preschool, three on the ground next to the school, two injured or dead civilians, and pools of blood. Amnesty International analysed 65 photos and videos of the event and interviewed local residents.[292] Bellingcat stated that remains of the 9M27K rocket were found 200 metres east of the kindergarten.

Amnesty described the rocket type as "unguided and notoriously inaccurate", and described the attack as potentially a war crime that should be investigated.[292]</p>

<h3><b>Sumy airstrikes</b></h3>
<p>In the evening and throughout the night on 7 March 2022, Russian forces executed an airstrike on Sumy's residential neighbourhood. About 22 people were killed, including three children.[293][294] Under the procedural guidance of the Sumy District Prosecutor's Office, criminal proceedings have been instituted for violating the laws and customs of war.[295]</p>
<p>On 19 September 2024, a Russian guided aerial bomb struck a five-story nursing home for the elderly in Sumy, killing at least one and injuring 12, according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. The oblast had been hit regularly by Russian shelling and airstrikes since the beginning of the invasion in 2022, but Ukraine's offensive into the Kursk Oblast brought the front line closer and led to an increase in attacks by Russia. The energy infrastructure in particular had been badly damaged in Sumy, as part of a broader Russian campaign to degrade Ukraine's power plants and make it more difficult for utilities to provide basic services.[296]</p>
<p>The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission said in a report that large-scale Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure ″have inflicted extensive harm and hardship on the country's civilian population, with potentially devastating consequences as winter approaches″.[296]</p>

<h3><b>Medical centre drone attacks</b></h3>

Regional prosecutors said there were 86 patients and 38 staff in the medical centre at the time of the attack.[297]</p>
<p>The method of hitting a target once and then striking the same target again as first responders arrive is known as a "double tap." Russia has been accused of carrying out strikes of this type during its invasion of Ukraine.[298]</p>

Missile strikes in the city centre. There are wounded and killed, among them a little child. Every day, Russia destroys the civilian population, kills Ukrainian children, directs rockets at civilian objects. Where there is nothing military. What is this if not an open terrorist attack? Inhuman. Country of killers. A country of terrorists".[309][310] The strike has also been labeled as a war crime by Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky.[305]</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense of Russia officially recognized the attack on Vinnytsia the next day, saying that they hit the garrison house of officers, where allegedly "...a meeting of the command of the Ukrainian Air Force with representatives of foreign arms suppliers was taking place..."

<br>

<h2>Placement of military objectives near civilian objects</h2>
<hr>
<p>Both the Russian and the Ukrainian army have been accused of violating international humanitarian law by locating military objectives within densely populated areas without removing civilians to safer areas.[346][347] International humanitarian law requires all parties to the conflict to avoid, to the extent feasible, "locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas"[348] and requires them to "remove civilian persons and objects under its control from the vicinity of military objectives".[349] Contrary to the use of human shields, these fighting tactics do not involve utilizing the presence of civilians to render certain areas immune from military operations.[350]</p>
<p>On 29 June, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about Russian and Ukrainian armed forces taking up positions close to civilian objects without taking measures for protecting the civilians. The human rights agency had also received reports of the use of human shields.[19]: para. 34  OHCHR documented the consequences of these fighting tactics in the case of a care house in Stara Krasnianka where the Ukrainian army had set up a firing position without first evacuating the residents, and in the case of a school in Yahidne, where 360 residents including 74 children were held captive by Russian forces for almost a month.[19]: para. 34  Similar concerns were raised also by a report published on 20 July by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe[346] and by Human Rights Watch on 21 July.[347]</p>
<p>Amnesty International said on 4 August that it had found evidence that Ukrainian forces had repeatedly put civilians in danger by establishing bases and firing positions in populated residential areas, including schools and hospitals; some areas were kilometres away from front lines and, according to Amnesty International, alternative locations were available to the Ukrainian army.[351] Between April and July, Amnesty International researchers found evidence that Ukrainian military objectives had been placed within residential areas in 19 towns and villages in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk and Mykolaiv oblasts. Amnesty International's Secretary General Agnès Callamard stated that there was "a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated area".[351] The Amnesty report sparked significant outrage in Ukraine and the West[352] and Oksana Pokalchuk, head of Amnesty International in Ukraine, resigned from her post and left the organization in protest over the publication of the report.[353] Amnesty's report was criticized by military and legal experts such as John Spencer, a specialist in urban warfare studies, who stated that advising Ukrainian forces not to be in urban areas did not make sense, as the circumstances of the war necessitated that.[354][355][356] United Nations war crime investigator Marc Garlasco stated that the Amnesty report got the law wrong, and also that Ukraine was making efforts to protect civilians, including helping them to relocate.[355]</p>
<p>In mid-October 2022, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine released a report which included findings that both Russian and Ukrainian forces had "deployed their military assets and troops in ways that can endanger civilians".[357][358]</p>
